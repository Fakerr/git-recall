## Purpose

`git-recall` is a simple tool that allows you to easily go through your commits and
check what you or other contributors in your team did. It doesn't aim to be a replacement for the 
`git log` command, but just to be a handy way to recall what you've done from your terminal.


## Usage

```sh
$ git recall   [-a <author name>] 
	           [-d <days-ago>]
               [-f]
               [-h]
```

##### Options description:

- `-a`      - Restrict search for a specific user (use -a "all" for all users)
- `-d`      - Display commits for the last n days
- `-f`      - Fetch the latest changes
- `-h`      - Show help screen

##### How to use:

Once the commits are displayed, you can use either the `arrow keys` or `j/k` to switch between commits,
press `TAB` to `expand/reduce` the commit's diff or `q` to quit.

##### Limitations:

when the number of lines between the commits list and a commit's diff is higher than the current terminal session's number of lines,
the result will be displayed using the [`less`](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/less.htm) program which will open the diff in a separate screen.
You can still use either `TAB` or `q` to return to the commits list.

## Examples

```sh
$ git recall
# By default (without options), the command will display commits from yesterday and
# for the current user.
```


```sh
$ git recall -d 5 -a "Doge"
# The command will show all Doge's commits from 5 days ago.

$ git recall -d 5 -a "all"
# The command will show commits of all contributors from 5 days ago.
```


```sh
$ git recall -f
# Fetch commits beforehand.
```

## Installation
